# Causal Inference Replication: Gasoline Content Regulation & Air Quality

This is the final project for "STAT 156: Causal Inference" with Professor Amanda Coston at UC Berkeley. We aim to replicate the findings of “Clearing the Air? The Effects of Gasoline Content Regulation on Air Quality” by Auffhammer and Kellogg. We analyze the effect of gasoline content regulations on ground-level ozone pollution in the US using causal inference methods including Difference-in-Differences (DiD), Regression Discontinuity, and Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) estimators. All analyses were performed in R.

This work was completed in collaboration with Yixin Feng and Jaeeun Park.
