# Replication Study: "Clearing the Air? The Effects of Gasoline Content Regulation on Air Quality”

This project replicates the findings of “Clearing the Air? The Effects of Gasoline Content Regulation on Air Quality” by Auffhammer and Kellogg. We analyze the effect of gasoline content regulations on ground-level ozone pollution in the US using statistical methods including Difference-in-Differences (DiD), Regression Discontinuity, and Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) estimators. All analyses were performed in R.
